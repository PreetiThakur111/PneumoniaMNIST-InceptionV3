##**Pneumonia Detection using Inception-V3**

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained **Inception-V3** model on the **PneumoniaMNIST** dataset to classify chest X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.

##  Dataset

- **Name**: PneumoniaMNIST
- **Source**: [Kaggle - PneumoniaMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rijulshr/pneumoniamnist/data)
- **Format**: `.npy` files:
  - `train_images.npy`, `train_labels.npy`
  - `val_images.npy`, `val_labels.npy`
  - `test_images.npy`, `test_labels.npy`


##  Setup Instructions

Install the required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

##**How to Run the Project**
Download the PneumoniaMNIST dataset as .npy files
Place all .npy files in your project directory
Open and run Pneumonia_Inception_V3.ipynb notebook ( Colab)
Training will run for 5 epochs and print evaluation results
## **Evaluation Metrics (on Test Set)**

      Normal       0.92      0.71      0.80       234
   Pneumonia       0.85      0.96      0.90       390

    accuracy                           0.87       624
   macro avg       0.88      0.84      0.85       624

##**Insights:**
Model achieved high recall (96%) for Pneumonia, making it suitable for early diagnosis
Performance for Normal cases improved significantly after handling class imbalance
Balanced F1-scores across both classes

##**Model Details**
Architecture: Inception-V3 from torchvision.models
Modifications: Final FC layer changed to output 2 classes
Input Size: 299x299 images (grayscale â†’ RGB)
Augmentation:RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomRotation, ColorJitter
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss with class weights to handle imbalance

##**Hyperparameter Choices**
 Parameter	     - Value	        - Reason
1.Learning Rate	- 0.001	          - Standard rate for Adam optimizer
2.Batch Size	  - 32	            - Balanced memory usage and training speed
3.Epochs        -	5	              - Sufficient to achieve convergence with pretrained model
4.Optimizer     -	Adam            - Efficient for deep learning and adaptive learning rates
5.Loss Function -	CrossEntropyLoss-  with weights	To penalize under-represented class

##**Summary**
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN (Inception-V3) for medical image classification. It also explores the impact of class imbalance and how to address it using data augmentation and weighted loss functions.
